# The Half-Double Exploit

This end-to-end exploits combines all the previous building bloks to hammer a PTE leading to an arbitrary read/write primitive. The end-to-end exploit also features a simulation mode, where the bitflips are simulated, i.e., induced via an priviledged interface. This simulation mode can be used to reduce the testing time.

This PoC consits of multiple parts.


## Building the PoC

To build run the following command:

```
make 
```

To build in simulation mode, run:

```
make simulate 
```

## Deploying the Artifacts

Please see [Deploying the Artifacts](../../README.md).


## Running the PoC

To run the PoC on the Chromebook, run:

```
./kukui_exploit
```

### Expected output:

```

```
